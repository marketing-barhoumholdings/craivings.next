The Lead Industry Is Broken
Raw, messy lead data
Inconsistent formats and incomplete 
information make lead evaluation nearly 
impossible.
No clarity before purchase
Buying leads blind without proper 
summaries or quality indicators.
Inconsistent pricing
No market guidance or standardized 
pricing across different lead sources.
Manual filtering
Time-consuming manual processes for 
sorting and qualifying leads.
Duplicate purchases
Accidentally buying the same leads 
multiple times without warning systems.
CRM exports → dead 
spreadsheets
Static exports that become outdated 
immediately with no sync capabilities.
LeadPass was built to bring structure, transparency, and automation to this 
infrastructure gap.
